# ALU Connect

**A role-based mobile platform connecting ALU students with campus startup opportunities.**

ALU Connect bridges ALU students seeking internship experience with student-led startups and early-stage ventures on campus. Startups post opportunities; students discover, apply, and track their applications in real time — replacing informal word-of-mouth and scattered group-chat postings that currently mediate this exchange.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Flutter 3.32 / Dart 3.8 |
| Authentication | Firebase Auth (email/password, role-based) |
| Database | Cloud Firestore (real-time streams) |
| State Management | BLoC / Cubit (`flutter_bloc`) |
| Navigation | GoRouter (declarative, role-aware) |
| Image Hosting | Cloudinary (profile photos) |
| Admin Provisioning | Firebase Admin SDK (Node.js seeding script) |
| Platform Target | Chrome (web, mobile DevTools view) |

---

## Features

### Student
- Role-based registration with ALU email (`@alustudent.com`) and email verification
- Opportunity discovery feed with real-time Firestore streaming
- Category filter chips and in-memory keyword search (no extra reads)
- Opportunity bookmarking
- One-click application with cover note and resume URL (Google Drive / Dropbox)
- Application status tracking pipeline: Applied → Under Review → Shortlisted → Interview → Accepted / Rejected
- In-app notifications with unread bell badge when startup updates application status

### Startup
- Role-based registration with ALU email and two-layer verification (email + admin approval)
- Pending verification banner blocks posting until admin approves
- Post, edit, close (status update), and permanently delete opportunities
- Applicants tab grouped by opportunity with applicant count and starred count per group
- Drill-down per opportunity: sort by newest/oldest, filter by status or starred
- Star / mark applicants for review
- Copy applicant email directly from the detail page for follow-up outside the platform
- Status changes automatically notify the student in-app

### Admin
- Separate dashboard accessible only to the `admin` role
- Review and approve pending startup registrations (flips `isVerified` in Firestore)
- Admin account provisioned via Firebase Admin SDK seeding script (not the public signup flow)

## Architecture

ALU Connect follows a strict three-layer architecture:

```
UI (Widgets)  →  BLoC / Cubit  →  Repository  →  Firebase
     ↑                ↑                              |
     └────────────────┴──────── state stream ────────┘
```

- **UI layer** — stateless widgets that render from BLoC/Cubit state. No direct Firestore calls anywhere in the UI.
- **BLoC / Cubit layer** — owns feature state (auth, opportunity feed, applications, notifications). Emits immutable state; widgets subscribe via `BlocBuilder` / `BlocListener`.
- **Repository layer** — the sole layer that talks to Firestore. All reads use `.snapshots()` streams for real-time updates. Isolating this layer means the backend can be swapped without touching UI or state code.
- **GoRouter** — declarative, role-aware routing. The `redirect` function enforces: unverified → `/verify-email`, not onboarded → `/onboarding`, admin → `/admin`, everyone else → `/home`.
- **Conditional imports** — `web.dart` / `stub.dart` pairs isolate any browser-only API (e.g. `dart:html` for iframe resume embedding) so the same feature code compiles for both web and mobile targets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.32+ and Dart 3.8+ (`flutter --version`)
- Chrome browser (the app targets Flutter web)
- A Firebase project with **Authentication** (Email/Password) and **Firestore** enabled
- A Cloudinary account with an unsigned upload preset for profile photos
- Node.js 18+ (only needed to run the admin seeding script)

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/alu-connect.git
cd alu-connect
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Configure Firebase

1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable **Email/Password** under Authentication → Sign-in method
3. Create a Firestore database (Start in production mode is fine; rules below)
4. Register a **Web** app and download the config
5. Run `flutterfire configure` (requires `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`) — this generates `lib/firebase_options.dart` which is gitignored

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root (gitignored):

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_unsigned_preset
```

### 4. Firestore security rules (recommended minimum)

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{uid} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;
    }
    match /startups/{id} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /opportunities/{id} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /applications/{id} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /notifications/{id} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Run the app

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Open Chrome DevTools → Toggle device toolbar and pick a phone viewport for the intended mobile layout.

---

## Admin Account Setup

The admin account cannot be created through the normal signup flow. It must be provisioned server-side using the Firebase Admin SDK seeding script.

### One-time setup

```bash
cd scripts
npm install firebase-admin
```

Download your **Service Account Key** from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate new private key. Save the file as `scripts/serviceAccountKey.json` (it is gitignored — never commit it).

### Run the script

```bash
node seed_admin.js
```

The script will:
1. Look up any existing user with `admin@aluconnect.com` in Firebase Auth and delete them
2. Delete the corresponding Firestore `users/` document if it exists
3. Create a fresh Auth user with `emailVerified: true`
4. Write the Firestore document with `role: 'admin'`, `isOnboarded: true`

**Admin credentials**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `admin@aluconnect.com` |
| Password | `Admin@2026` |

> Change the password in the Firebase Console after first login.

## Demo

### Video Walkthrough

[![ALU Connect Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Watch%20Demo-YouTube-red?logo=youtube)](https://youtu.be/oFa65CZeCs4)

> **[https://youtu.be/oFa65CZeCs4](https://youtu.be/oFa65CZeCs4)**

The demo covers:
- Student signup with ALU email + email verification
- Student onboarding (skills, program)
- Startup registration and pending verification state
- Admin login and startup approval flow
- Posting, closing, and deleting an opportunity
- Student applying with a cover note and resume link
- Startup managing applicants (star, status update)
- In-app notification received by the student

### Screenshots

| Role | Screen |
|------|--------|
| Student | Opportunity feed with category filters and live search |
| Student | Application status tracker (Applied → Accepted) |
| Startup | Applicants tab grouped by opportunity |
| Admin | Dashboard — pending startup approval queue |

## Technical Report

The full technical report, including system design decisions, data flow diagrams, ERD, and evaluation against the assignment rubric, is available in the repository:

> [`CedricBienvenue_FinalFlutterProject.pdf`](CedricBienvenue_FinalFlutterProject.pdf)

### Key design decisions documented in the report

- **BLoC/Cubit over setState** — Chosen for clear separation of business logic and testability across features with complex async flows (auth, applications, notifications)
- **Firestore streams over polling** — Real-time `snapshots()` throughout so the UI reflects backend state without manual refresh
- **Single-field queries + in-memory sort** — Avoids composite Firestore index requirements on the free Spark plan while preserving sort order
- **Optimistic state emit** — Cubits emit new state before the Firestore write completes; users see instant feedback without waiting for round-trip latency
- **Conditional web/stub imports** — Isolates `dart:html` usage so startup resume embedding compiles cleanly on all targets
- **Admin SDK seeding** — Admin account created server-side to bypass the public signup flow; avoids a fake email recovery scenario
